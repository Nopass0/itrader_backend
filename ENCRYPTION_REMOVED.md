# Encryption Removal Complete

As per your request ("Не нужно ничего шифровать"), all encryption has been removed from the system.

## Changes Made:

1. **Account Storage System**
   - Modified `src/core/account_storage.rs` to store all data in plain text JSON files
   - Removed all `encrypt_string` and `decrypt_string` calls
   - Changed field names from `password_encrypted` to `password`
   - Changed field names from `api_secret_encrypted` to `api_secret`

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Removed `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `.env` file
   - Removed encryption key requirements from `AppState`

3. **Gate Authentication**
   - Updated `src/gate/auth.rs` to use the new plain text account storage
   - Removed all crypto imports and decryption calls
   - Integrated `AccountStorage` instead of using encrypted repository data

4. **Account Data Structure**
   All account data is now stored as plain JSON in the `db/` folder:
   ```
   db/
   ├── gate/          # Gate.io accounts (plain text)
   ├── bybit/         # Bybit accounts (plain text)
   ├── gmail/         # Gmail credentials
   ├── transactions/  # Transaction history
   └── checks/        # Receipt files
   ```

## Security Note

Since encryption has been removed:
- Ensure the `db/` folder has restricted file system permissions
- Do not commit the `db/` folder to version control
- Consider using disk encryption at the OS level
- Keep backups secure

## Running the Application

The application now runs without requiring an encryption key:
```bash
./run_with_python.sh
```

All functionality remains the same, just without encryption.
