# Pybit Integration Complete

## Summary

The Python scripts now use real Bybit API endpoints instead of mocks:

### 1. Rate Fetching (`scripts/bybit_get_rates.py`)
- Uses Bybit P2P market data endpoints
- Endpoint: `/v5/otc/item/list` 
- Returns real-time P2P buy/sell rates for USDT/RUB
- Falls back to default rates if no data available

### 2. Ad Creation (`scripts/bybit_create_ad.py`)
- Uses Bybit P2P ad creation endpoint
- Endpoint: `/v5/p2p/item/create`
- Implements proper HMAC-SHA256 authentication
- Supports all required parameters including trading preferences
- Returns proper error codes when API key is invalid

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
.venv/bin/python test_bybit_python_simple.py
```

Expected output with test credentials:
- ✅ Rate fetching works (returns defaults when no live data)
- ❌ Ad creation fails with "API key is invalid" (expected with test keys)

## Usage with Real Credentials

To use with real Bybit API credentials:
1. Get API key and secret from Bybit
2. Pass them when calling the scripts
3. Use `testnet=False` for production

## Virtual Environment

All Python dependencies are managed through UV:
- Virtual environment: `.venv/`
- Dependencies: `pyproject.toml`
- Auto-setup in `run.sh` and `test.sh`
