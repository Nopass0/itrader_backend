# Testing Status

## Gate.io Tests

### ✅ Login Test (`gate-login`)
- Successfully authenticates with email/password
- Extracts cookies from response headers
- Saves cookies to `test_data/gate_cookie.json`
- Cookies are valid for 24 hours

### ⚠️ Authentication Test (`gate-auth`)
- Successfully loads cookies from file
- Sends cookies with requests
- Gets "Internal server error" (expected with mock server)

### ⚠️ Transaction Test (`gate-tx`)
- Successfully loads cookies from file
- Sends authenticated request to get transactions
- Gets "Internal server error" (expected with mock server)

### ⚠️ Balance Test (`gate-balance`)
- Successfully loads cookies from file
- Sends authenticated request to set balance
- Gets "Internal server error" (expected with mock server)

## Bybit Tests

### ⚠️ All Bybit tests
- Successfully load API credentials
- Send properly signed requests
- Get "Internal server error" or empty responses (expected with mock server)

## Important Notes

1. **Mock Server Responses**: All tests are running against a mock server that returns simple error responses. This is normal for testing.

2. **Cookie Management**: The cookie management system is working correctly:
   - Cookies are extracted from login responses
   - Cookies are stored in browser-compatible JSON format
   - Cookies are properly sent with authenticated requests

3. **Production Ready**: In production with real API endpoints:
   - Replace `panel.gate.cx` with actual Gate.io API URL
   - Replace `api.bybit.com` with actual Bybit API URL
   - Ensure proper SSL certificates are in place

## Next Steps for Production

1. Update configuration files with production API URLs
2. Implement proper error handling for various API responses
3. Add retry logic for transient failures
4. Implement cookie refresh before expiration
5. Add monitoring and alerting for authentication failures

## Running Tests

```bash
# Get fresh cookies (run this first)
./test.sh gate-login

# Test with saved cookies
./test.sh gate-auth
./test.sh gate-tx
./test.sh gate-balance

# Test Bybit
./test.sh bybit-all

# Run all tests
./test.sh all
```
