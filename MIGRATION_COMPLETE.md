# Data Migration to PostgreSQL - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated all data from file-based storage to PostgreSQL database and fixed the number formatting issue.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed Number Formatting Issue ✅
- Updated `/home/user/projects/itrader_backend/scripts/db_account_manager.sh`
- Added `LC_NUMERIC=C` to all `printf` statements to ensure consistent number formatting
- Lines updated: 65, 112, 288

### 2. Database Schema Created ✅
Created new tables in migration file `migrations/004_create_settings_and_sessions.sql`:
- **settings** - Application configuration with admin token, intervals, etc.
- **gate_cookies** - Gate.io session data and cookies
- **bybit_sessions** - Bybit API session data
- Added appropriate indexes and update triggers

### 3. Data Migration ✅
Successfully migrated all data:
- **Settings**: 1 record (admin token, intervals, etc.)
- **Gate accounts**: 1 account (keilvan731@gmail.com)
- **Bybit accounts**: 2 accounts (robertdronov, test_bybit)
- **Gate cookies**: 1 session
- **Bybit sessions**: 1 session

### 4. Application Code Updated ✅
Created database-backed implementations:
- `src/core/db_account_manager.rs` - Database-backed account management
- `src/core/db_account_storage.rs` - Database-backed storage for sessions
- Updated `src/core/state.rs` to include both file and DB managers
- Added `use_db_storage` configuration option (defaults to true)

### 5. Cleanup ✅
- Created backup: `backup_before_removal_20250605_135717.tar.gz`
- Removed `data/` directory
- Removed `db/` directory

## Migration Scripts Created

1. **Python Migration Script**: `scripts/migrate_json_to_db.py` (requires psycopg2)
2. **Shell Migration Script**: `scripts/migrate_json_to_db.sh` (uses psql and jq)
3. **Verification Script**: `scripts/verify_db_migration.sh`

## Verified Migration Results

All data successfully migrated:
- ✅ Gate accounts match (1 = 1)
- ✅ Bybit accounts match (2 = 2)
- ✅ Gate cookies match (1 = 1)
- ✅ Bybit sessions match (1 = 1)

## Next Steps

The application is now using PostgreSQL for all data storage. The old file-based storage has been removed, and a backup was created before removal.

To use the database account manager in your scripts:
```bash
./scripts/db_account_manager.sh
```

All printf formatting issues have been resolved using `LC_NUMERIC=C`.
